  <h2>Game Modes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Classic</h3>
      <img src="Classic.jpg" alt="Classic" width="300px">
      <p>Classic is the first and earliest game mode in Mobile Legends. All other game modes use the rules in Classic as a base. This mode gives 5v5 and the Mobile Legends experience without worrying about losing your Rank, but your win rate will be affected, both from the hero side and the whole.​​​​</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Ranked</h3>
      <img src="Ranked.jpg" alt="Ranked" width="300px">
      <p>Ranked is a competitive queue for a game that is normally played. The rank system is used in matchmaking to ensure that all players played equally and fairly. Players earn or lose stars if they win or lose in this mode. Warrior, Elite, Master, Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and Mythic (Mythical Glory) are the seven ranks in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Brawl</h3>
      <img src="Brawl.jpg" alt="Brawl" width="300px">
      <p>In Brawl Mode you are unable to choose your heroes freely. Instead you will be given a choice between two random heroes in your inventory. This mode contains only one lane with two turrets defending the base in both teams respectively. Brawl matches usually end in a much shorter time compared to Classic Mode and Ranked. This type of match is best for raising lost credit scores due to reports and AFK behavior.</p>
